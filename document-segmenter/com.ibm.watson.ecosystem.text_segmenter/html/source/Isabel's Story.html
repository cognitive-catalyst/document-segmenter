   <p><strong>May 2007</strong></p> 
   <p>This is a story about Isabel and how she and her family learned about osteoporosis and bone health. The cover has pictures of Isabel, her fall, Isabel talking with her doctor, and Isabel and her family talking a walk.</p> 
   <p>The next page introduces the characters in Isabel’s Story: Isabel, a middle-aged woman, her husband Juan, her son-in-law Carlos, her daughter Elena, her son Tony, her grandson N&eacute;stor, and her mother Do&ntilde;a Carla.</p> 
   <p><em>At Isabel’s house</em>… Isabel enters the house through the kitchen door with bags of groceries in her arms. The kitchen is a mess. Popcorn is cooking in the microwave. Its alarm goes “Beep! Beep! Beep!” The refrigerator door is open. A roll of paper towels flows down to the floor. Her dog is barking, “Arf! Arf!” The dog’s food and water are spilled on the floor. The phone is ringing, “Ring! Ring! Ring!” A small rug is out of place and slipping under Isabel’s feet.</p> 
   <div class="picRight"></div> 
   <p>Isabel uses her hip to close the refrigerator’s door with a “thump.” Her dog continues to bark, “Arf!” She puts the bags of groceries on the counter and stops the “Beep! Beep!” of the microwave. The phone is still ringing, “Ring! Ring!” Isabel rushes to answer it. She says, “Hello?” The caller—Isabel’s son-in-law—replies, “Do&ntilde;a Isabel, this is Carlos. Please tell Elena I can’t leave work just yet. I’ll be late for the party.” The party is to celebrate the birthday of Isabel’s mother, Do&ntilde;a Carla.</p> 
   <p>Isabel’s son Tony and his friends walk into the kitchen. Tony greets her, “Hi mom! How was work?” Tony’s friend says, “Hello, Do&ntilde;a Isabel.”</p> 
   <p>Isabel’s daughter Elena, who is expecting a baby, and grandson N&eacute;stor walk into the kitchen. Elena says, “Look what I’ve got, Mom! The birthday cake!” Elena shows the cake to her mom and brother Tony. Isabel says, “Thank you, Elena. Your husband called. He’s going to be a little late.”</p> 
   <p>Isabel, Elena, N&eacute;stor, Tony, and Tony’s friends gather in the kitchen. Isabel says, “Did you see my new camera? I’m going to take pictures at the party.” As she shows her new camera to her family and friends, the phone rings, “Ring! Ring!”</p> 
   <p>Isabel’s husband Juan is at Do&ntilde;a Carla’s house. Juan whispers into the phone, “Hello, sweetheart. Is everything ready?” Do&ntilde;a Carla stands in the background, putting her coat on. Isabel answers, “Almost. Don’t forget to bring my mother around to the back door.” In the backyard, Tony stands on a ladder to hang a birthday banner.</p> 
   <div class="picLeft"></div> 
   <p><em>Later</em>… Isabel’s family and friends are gathered in the backyard, waiting for Do&ntilde;a Carla to arrive at her surprise party. The large “Happy Birthday” banner hangs between trees in the background. Carlos says, “Grandma is here!” The family and friends shout, “Surprise!” A family friend calls out, “Do&ntilde;a Carla!” Isabel greets her mother, “Happy Birthday!”</p> 
   <p>Isabel, Do&ntilde;a Carla, and N&eacute;stor are standing by the back door that goes into the kitchen. N&eacute;stor says, “Let’s measure your height, great grandmother!” Do&ntilde;a Carla replies, “That’s right …”</p> 
   <p>N&eacute;stor is holding his great grandmother’s hand, and she says, “It’s our family tradition on birthdays, isn’t it?” The family members’ heights are marked on the door frame. Do&ntilde;a Carla stands against the door frame. She holds her hand between the top of her head and the door frame. She says, “I’m not as tall as I used to be. I’ve shrunk over the years.” Isabel wonders, “Could that happen to me?”</p> 
   <p><em>Later at the party</em>… In the backyard, Do&ntilde;a Carla and her family and friends gather around the birthday cake. Isabel decides to take a picture. She says, “Wait! Let me get my camera.” She goes into the kitchen through the back door.</p> 
   <p>Isabel’s family hears a loud sound in the kitchen, “Crash!” They rush into the kitchen and find Isabel on the floor, lying on her side and clutching her wrist. She is in pain. “Are you alright, my daughter?” Do&ntilde;a Carla asks. Elena asks, “Mom, what happened?” Grimacing, Isabel says, “Ow! It hurts! I think I broke my wrist.” Juan says, “I’m taking you to the hospital!”</p> 
   <div class="picCenter"></div> 
   <p>Isabel, Juan, and Do&ntilde;a Carla are in a car. Juan is driving them to the hospital. Isabel holds her wrist in pain. </p> 
   <p><em>Two weeks later</em>… Isabel sits on an examination table in a doctor’s office. Her arm is in a sling. Her husband Juan stands at her side. Isabel and Juan are talking to the doctor about her test results. The doctor says, “Remember when you first broke your wrist, and I ordered a bone density test to see how strong your bones were?” “Yes,” Isabel replies.</p> 
   <p>The doctor explains the results of the bone density test to Isabel and Juan. A bone density test measures bone density, tells you if you have osteoporosis, and is quick, easy, and painless. The doctor tells Isabel, “The results show that you have osteoporosis.” She replies, “How can that be? I feel fine!” The doctor continues, “Osteoporosis has no symptoms. You don’t notice it until you break a bone. Signs that you may have broken a bone include height loss or a curved back which is called kyphosis.</p> 
   <div class="picCenter"></div> 
   <p>Isabel asks her doctor, “What is osteoporosis?” “Osteoporosis is a disease that makes your bones weak and more likely to break,” the doctor explains. The doctor gives to Isabel and Juan a booklet titled, Taking Care of Your Bone Health. The doctor further explains, “Because you had this fracture, you are at increased risk for another fracture … so it is very important that you take care of your bones.”</p> 
   <p>Osteoporosis is known as the “silent disease.” At first, osteoporosis has no symptoms. Often it is not diagnosed until after there has been a fracture. There are a few warning signs, such as loss of height or a curved back.</p> 
   <div class="picRight"></div> 
   <p>Juan says, “Do&ntilde;a Carla has lost height. Maybe she has osteoporosis, too. She needs to see a doctor!” If you have any of these warning signs, talk to your doctor about getting evaluated for osteoporosis.</p> 
   <p>Isabel and her husband are reading the booklet about bone health. Juan says, “This has good information for you, Isabel, about how to prevent fractures in the future.” Isabel replies, “These tips are good for the whole family! We need to make sure that you, our children, and grandchildren have healthy bones.”</p> 
   <div class="clear-all"></div> 
   <div class="picLeft"></div> 
   <p>The doctor tells them, “Although osteoporosis can affect anyone, some people are at greater risk.”</p> 
   <div class="fotonovellaBold"> 
    <p class="fotonovellaBoldPurple">Osteoporosis risk factors include:</p>

   <p>Isabel reads a list on how to prevent falls. She learns that it is very important for people with osteoporosis to prevent falls.</p> 
   <div class="fotonovellaBold"> 
    <p class="fotonovellaBoldPurple">To prevent falls:</p> 
    <ul class="list_regular">

   <div class="clear-all"></div> 
   <div class="picRight"></div> 
   <p><em>Three months later</em>… Isabel and her husband walk into their kitchen carrying groceries. Isabel carries one bag, and Juan carries one bag. The kitchen is clean and tidy. There are no rugs on the floor. Smiling, Isabel tells her husband, “I love my kitchen now that the clutter is gone!” Her husband replies, “…so you won’t fall again.”</p> 
   <p>Isabel is in the kitchen unpacking the groceries. Her daughter Elena stands next to her, holding her newborn baby. Isabel’s son Tony is looking in the refrigerator and says, “We’re out of sodas, Mom.”</p> 
   <p>Isabel pulls a milk carton out of a grocery bag and replies, “I’ve got something much better for you right here!” As Tony pours the milk into a glass, Elena says, “You never used to buy so much milk and cheese before.” Isabel responds, “Now I am always thinking about our bone health. It’s never too late—or too early—to take better care of our bones. I even found healthy snacks for the kids!”</p> 
   <div class="fotonovellaBold">
